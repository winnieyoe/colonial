          <h2>Same street.  <br>5,900 miles apart.</h2>
          <p>The naming of streets and roads is arbitrary, in fact, it often embeds hints of a place’s local history.
            Many of the street names in Hong Kong reflects its colonial past (1800s — 1997), with streets being named after
            British royal family and officials, Chinese and expatriate elites in Hong Kong, local and foreign enterprises,
            while others are named after industries, historical sites, and Chinese cities and provinces. Explore HK vs UK Streets

          <p>
            This has led to streets in Hong Kong and the UK sharing the same name. The translation of streetnames has also led to
            accidental namings, such as how “Alexandra Terrace” became “Rednaxela Terrace”  as Chinese is usually read from left to right.
